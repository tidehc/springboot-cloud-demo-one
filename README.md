# springboot-cloud-demo-one
Java application for Spring Cloud training

## Trainings
There will be several trainings with presentations and demo projects. The goal is to refactor some simple monolith application to several microservices and make aquintance with popular spring cloud services and tools.

Since monolith and microservices projects should evolve in parallel, to be available for comparison, I created several branches. “master” branch will contain no code. It will contain presentations used in training:
* [Introduction to microservices Part 1 : Monolith](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_1_monolith.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 2 : Spring Boot](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_2_boot.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 3 : Microservices](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_3_microservice.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 4 : Security](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_4_security.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 5 : CQRS](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_5_cqrs.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 6 : Docker](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_6_docker.pptx)
* [Introduction to microservices Part 7 : Kubernetes](../../raw/master/docs/Introduction_To_Microservices_Part_7_kubernetes.pptx)

Branch https://github.com/vlytsus/springboot-cloud-demo-one/tree/spring_boot_2_maven_monolith will contain monolith application.

Branch https://github.com/vlytsus/springboot-cloud-demo-one/tree/spring_boot_2_maven_microservices will represent the same application but refactored and decomposed using microservices architecture.

1st training is about monolith application which allows you to store/query users and emails in the database. Please checkout branch for 1st training: https://github.com/vlytsus/springboot-cloud-demo-one/tree/spring_boot_2_maven_monolith
